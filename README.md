# Rust by Example - Learning and Experiments

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This project serves as a playground where I explore and experiment with Rust concepts from the **Rust by Example** book. Having completed the main Rust book, I’m diving deeper into real-world examples and code snippets to enhance my understanding of the language.

## What is this repository about?

This repository contains code examples and experiments based on the **Rust by Example** book. Here, I will try out different Rust features, experiment with various patterns, and implement small projects as I work through the book’s exercises. It’s my way of solidifying the knowledge I've gained and learning by building.

## Why this repo?

- To apply Rust concepts in real-world scenarios.
- To solidify my understanding of Rust through practical coding examples.
- To improve coding skills by experimenting with different Rust patterns, libraries, and tools.
- To track my progress and create a portfolio of mini Rust projects.

## Structure

- `examples/`: Contains various Rust examples, each corresponding to a chapter or topic from the book.
- `projects/`: Mini-projects that showcase the concepts learned.
- `snippets/`: Short code snippets demonstrating specific Rust features and patterns.
